# Compliance Checklist Repository

This repository provides checklists that can be used by security practitioners to ensure compliance with various standards and frameworks, such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Each checklist is provided in the form of a markdown file and includes a set of tasks that organizations can use to assess their compliance with the relevant standard or framework. The checklists are provided for informational purposes only and should be customized based on the specific needs of the organization and its IT environment.

## Usage

To use a checklist, simply open the corresponding markdown file and review the tasks included in the checklist. Each task includes a checkbox that can be used to track progress and completion of the task.

It is important to note that compliance with standards and frameworks is an ongoing process, and the checklists should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure continued compliance.

## Future Work

We aim to continue expanding the repository to include checklists for other relevant standards and frameworks. Here are 10 additional standards that could be added in the future:

1. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
2. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
3. ISO/IEC 27001:2013
4. Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP)
5. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX)
6. National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM)
7. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
8. Center for Internet Security (CIS) Controls
9. Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC)
10. California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)

Each of these standards and frameworks has its own set of requirements that organizations must follow to ensure compliance. By providing checklists for these standards, we aim to make it easier for security practitioners to assess their compliance with these requirements and maintain a strong security posture.

If you would like to contribute a checklist for any of these standards or suggest other standards to add to the repository, please create a pull request or submit an issue with your suggestion.
